# AdmissionPredictor

### Many colleges in the U.S. follow similar requirements for student admission. Colleges take different factors into account, such as the ranking on aptitude assessment and academic record review. The command over the English language is calculated on the basis of their performance in the English skills test, such as TOEFL and IELTS. The admission committee of universities takes the decision to approve or reject a specific candidate on the basis of the overall profile of the applicant application.
### So I am building a web app which will take  GRE Score, TOEFL Score and CGPA as input and with the help of trained model with linear regression algorithm it will provide a output as "Chance of Admission: ---%".

### I have made this project as a fulfillment for a virtual internship, Future Ready Talent organized by Microsoft.
### It is hosted on azure cloud by using azure webapp service and azure ML services.
